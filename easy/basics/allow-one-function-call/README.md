## 📝 Description
Given a function fn, return a new function that is identical to the original function except that it ensures&nbsp;fn&nbsp;is&nbsp;called at most once.


	The first time the returned function is called, it should return the same result as&nbsp;fn.
	Every subsequent time it is called, it should return&nbsp;undefined.

Example 1:


Input: fn = (a,b,c) =&gt; (a + b + c), calls = [[1,2,3],[2,3,6]]
Output: [{&quot;calls&quot;:1,&quot;value&quot;:6}]
Explanation:
const onceFn = once(fn);
onceFn(1, 2, 3); // 6
onceFn(2, 3, 6); // undefined, fn was not called


Example 2:


Input: fn = (a,b,c) =&gt; (a * b * c), calls = [[5,7,4],[2,3,6],[4,6,8]]
Output: [{&quot;calls&quot;:1,&quot;value&quot;:140}]
Explanation:
const onceFn = once(fn);
onceFn(5, 7, 4); // 140
onceFn(2, 3, 6); // undefined, ...
